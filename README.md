# RaspiPiFaceReco

Scripts to perform the task of facial recognition using the raspberry pi, a motion sensor and the picamera.

This was my final project for the electrical engineering course at UFMG. At that time I was begining to learn about machine learning and discovering some of the amazing things it can do.

These scripts were inspired on many sources including:
